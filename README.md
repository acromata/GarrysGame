# Garry's Game
Named after one of my biggest inspirations, Mr Garry.

A remake of Crab Game by Dani because my friend begged me for 3 months to do so, making it my first multiplayer game.
Probably won't release until the near future, but feel free to download code and build yourself in Unreal Engine 5.
